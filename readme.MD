**To Govee** - This project was made because there is no public library for controlling your non-wifi lights. If you want me to remove this repository from public view, I will do so, please just send me a message.

 > Requires gatttool - this may mean it only works on linux

    app get install gatttool

This repository allows you to control the **colour and brightness** of Govee **H61382A1UK Bluetooth LED strips**. This code may work for other models but there are no guarentees.

with thanks to **egold555** - https://github.com/egold555/Govee-H6113-Reverse-Engineering for their initial work that I was able to adapt.
